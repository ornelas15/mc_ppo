Ex.3
The file /etc/dictionaries-common/words contains a list of words
(in english), one per line. Some of those words have equal 
consecutive letters, such as â€œaccent", "access", "pool", etc.
Develop a program to list and count all those words.  
Suggestion: start by creating the function int 
checkDoubles(const string &w), which returns the number of 
letter pairs found in string w and test it conveniently.
