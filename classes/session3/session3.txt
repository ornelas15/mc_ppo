Session 3 of PPOC++:

- References:
	- & operator and it refers to an existing variable.
	
- Pointers vs References:
	- similar but the difference is that the pointer, requires "*var" while after referering &var = var2, it can be called var.
	

- Functions

	- Function Parameters
	- Default Parameters (only from right to left)
	- Recursive Functions
	- Overload Functions (as long as the parameters are different, functions can have same name)
