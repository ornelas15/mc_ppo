Ex.9: 
Write a function which calculates the greatest common divisor 
between two integer positive numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, 
given by the following definition:
gdc(a,b) = a if b = 0; gdc(r,b) if b > 0.
where r is the remainder of the division of a by b. 
Use it in a program which requests that value to the user. 
Provide two different implementations.
