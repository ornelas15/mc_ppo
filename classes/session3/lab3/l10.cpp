Ex.10: 
The Fibonnaci sequence is a sequence of integers in which each
element is equal to the sum of the two preceding ones: 
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. The first values are defined as F0 = 0 and
e^f1 = 1. Write a function, Fibonnaci(n), to calculate the
n^th Fibonnaci number.
Which is the value of F40? 
Provide two different implementations.
