Ex.3:
It is intended to implement a simplified information system for the management of a university library. The library contains a book catalog and a set of users (students only). All users are identified by their university number (nMec), name and course. The books are characterized by an ID (numeric and sequential, starting at 100), title and type of loan (CONDITIONAL or NORMAL). Start with the following settings:

Make use of access modifiers to ensure that all class attributes are not accessible from outside. If necessary, define new attributes to meet the requirements of the specification.

Using the developed classes, implement a program that, in an interactive way (using a menu), allows managing the library, users and loans. Each student can only request a maximum of 3 books simultaneously. You must modify the user class to be able to store the IDs of the requested books, as well as the class book to indicate their availability.

The program must allow the enrollment and removal of users. For books, the program should allow the introduction of books, make a loan and allow the return of books. For simplicity, consider that there is only one copy of each book and that books with a CONDITIONAL loan type can not be ordered.

Implement a program that interactively (using a menu) allows you to manage the library, users and loans. The program must allow the enrollment and removal of users. For books, the program should allow the introduction of books in the system, check availability of a certain item, loan and return of books. It is recommended that loan and return operations be performed based on the book ID and the student's number.
