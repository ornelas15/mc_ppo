Ex.2
Write a function called hms_to_secs() that takes three int values - 
for hours, minutes, and seconds - as arguments, and returns the equivalent time
in seconds (type long). 
Create a program that exercises this function by repeatedly obtaining 
a time value in hours, minutes, and seconds from the user (format 12:59:59),
calling the function, and displaying the value of seconds it returns.
