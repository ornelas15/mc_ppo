Ex.2
Implement a program to count words and count the occurrence of
a specific keyword. You should only consider exact matches, i.e.
if the keyword is "contained" inside another word should not be 
counted. The program should start getting from the user a keyword 
and then gets paragraphs (a paragraph finishes with the symbol '$')
in an iterative way (the user has to write a paragraph with the 
word "End" to finish the program). For each introduced paragraph,
the program should count the number of words in the paragraph 
(consider the most common symbols as separators) and count
the number of occurrences of the keyword.
